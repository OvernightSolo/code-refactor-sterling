# Code Refactor Starter Code

## My objective is to find opportunities to refactor code by consolidating attributes and generally improving the design of the code in order to increase readability and potentially perform faster, while still maintaining the integrity and functionality of the site.

I added alt attributes to all images.

I combined class attributes in lines 90, 98, 106, 115, 127, and 134 in the CSS file

I repaired the bookmark function for the Search Engine Optimization menu item at the top so that it jumps down the appropriate section, similar to the other two menu items.

The text-decoration element (line 49 in the CSS) didn't seem to do anything, so I commented it out instead of deleting outright, in case it needs to be put back in.

I removed the .header h1 class/element from line 25 because it didn't seem to be necessary. It is only the .seo class that is affected by the color in line 26.
